# Purpose


### Foreword

Corporate Strategy exists to do one thing: bring coherence and discipline to complexity. For Nissan Americas, that means turning fragmented priorities, disparate directives, and reactive firefighting into a **single, actionable plan**.

The purpose of this strategy is not abstract planning. It is to **focus the region’s voice, capital, and execution** around what matters most: profitable growth, competitive relevance, and long-term credibility with customers, dealers, and investors.

By defining clear direction, embedding mass-profit discipline, and aligning execution across product, powertrain, and services, this Corporate Strategy aims to give Nissan Americas what it has lacked: **a unifying compass that connects ambition to delivery**.

### Purpose

The creation of an **Americas Corporate Strategy** is both urgent and unavoidable. Nissan Americas is the single largest contributor to global volume and profit, yet its influence on global decision-making has been disproportionately small. The region carries **40% of the business but only 5–10% of the voice in global product planning**.

This imbalance, combined with volatile directives and execution gaps, has left the Americas market vulnerable:

- A product pipeline with limited visibility beyond the next model cycle.
    
- An absence of clear powertrain and services strategy — “_This needs to be addressed or the company will die_”.
    
- Indiscriminate cost cutting that undermines creativity, governance processes that waste time without impact, and a lack of boldness in product decisions.
    
- Tariff and fixed cost headwinds that erode competitiveness and margins.
    

The objective of this document is straightforward: to **define a coherent, actionable strategy for Nissan in the Americas** — one that bridges global intent with local execution, translates ambition into operational reality, and ensures that every dollar of capital deployed in the Americas is focused on **profitability and long-term growth**.

This is not a technical exercise in financial optimization, nor a theoretical planning document. It is a **call to executional clarity**. The Americas organization requires a common plan that:

- **Unifies leadership** and employees behind consistent messages and decisions.
    
- **Re-orients around profitability and mass profit** rather than volume or unit economics alone.
    
- **Provides direction to design, product planning, and manufacturing** on what Nissan and Infiniti will build, for whom, and why.
    
- **Builds credibility** with dealers, employees, and investors through transparent execution.
    

This Americas Corporate Strategy begins by focusing on Nissan’s most urgent gaps: clarity of direction, disciplined execution, and restoring relevance in the U.S. market.

The path forward will not be solved by one initiative alone. It requires **systemic alignment** — from product to powertrain, from governance to customer experience. But success starts with this document: a structured strategy, written in plain language, anchored in facts and voices from across the business, and designed to serve as a **living reference for the next five years**.
