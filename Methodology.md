**Foreword**  

The Corporate Strategy for Nissan Americas was developed to align global ambition with U.S. market realities. It is based not only on financial and operational data, but also on the lived experience of employees, dealers, and stakeholders — ensuring recommendations are grounded, actionable, and regionally relevant.

### 1. Approach

We applied a **dual-track methodology**, combining:

- **Business Discovery** → 120+ interviews with leaders and staff across functions (Product, PMO, Sales, Manufacturing, Finance, Treasury, HR, Marketing, Dealer Network, Design, R&D, Purchasing, Field force).
    
- **Data & Document Analysis** → review of financial results, Re:Nissan, CEO and Executive updates, and operational reports.

This ensured a balance of **qualitative insights (culture, governance, execution barriers)** and **quantitative evidence (profitability, cost, volume, tariffs)**.

### 2. Activities Conducted

- **Stakeholder Interviews & Workshops**
    
    - Uncovered pain points, gaps, and opportunities across product, governance, cost, and brand.
        
    - Gathered candid perspectives reflected in verbatim quotes.
        
- **Thematic Synthesis**
    
    - Insights were clustered into **10 strategic themes** (Profitability, Product & Powertrain, Governance, U.S. Voice, Customer & Brand, Costs & Footprint, Non Auto, Boldness & Culture, Retail & Dealer Alignment, Execution & Accountability).
        
    - Each theme was structured into: Current State → Strategic Implications → Recommendations → Quotes.
        
- **Benchmarking & Best Practices**
    
    - Reviewed competitor strategies (Toyota, Hyundai, Tesla, Ford) for product cadence, powertrain clarity, cost structure, and services monetization.
        
    - Adapted lessons to Nissan’s specific context.
        
- **Integration with Re:Nissan Framework**
    
    - Aligned recommendations with the three Re:Nissan pillars: Variable TdC, Fixed Cost, and Topline Optimization.
        
    - Ensured Corporate Strategy adds executional clarity and long-term direction on top of near-term turnaround measures.

### 3. Guiding Principles

- **Business Value First** → focus on profitability, customer relevance, and execution discipline.
    
- **Regionally Grounded** → U.S. voice embedded in all recommendations, ensuring product/brand fit for American customers.
    
- **Practical & Actionable** → every recommendation tied to a short, mid, or long-term time horizon (FY25 → FY27 → FY30 → FY40).
    
- **Candid & Evidence-Based** → insights anchored in direct employee quotes, real financials, and operational realities.
    
- **Execution-Oriented** → Corporate Strategy seen not as a presentation exercise, but as a living roadmap with owners, KPIs, and timelines.
